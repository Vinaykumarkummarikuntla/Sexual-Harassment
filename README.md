# Sexual-Harassment

**What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?**

While there are some apparent ways that people are molested like unwanted kissing, touching of privates, butt slapping, making sexually explicit comments, uninvited massages, requests for sexual favours, sexually suggestive gestures, ogling, catcalls or cornering someone in a tight space, there are more subtle forms of harassments too. Some of them are listed below:

- Making sexual jokes.
- Repeated compliments of an employee's appearance.
- Commenting on the attractiveness of others in front of an employee.
- Discussing someone's sex life in front of a colleague.
- Circulating nude photos of women in bikinis or shirtless men in the workplace.
- Interrogating an employee about their sex life.
- Leaving unwanted gifts of a sexual or romantic nature.
- Spreading sexual rumours about a colleague.
- Repeating hugs or other types of unwanted touching.

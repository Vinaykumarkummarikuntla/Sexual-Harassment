# Sexual-Harassment

## What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?


As a sociologist who focuses on gender and work, I’m all too familiar with the reality of sexual harassment. Surveys show that it affects nearly 40 percent of women, that less than a quarter formally report it, and that those who do are likely to experience retaliation from their employer. 

What’s not always clear, even to experts on the issue, is precisely what to advise those who experience it. Often, when deciding what to do, women must weigh their ability to pay the bills — or advance in their careers — against being treated with dignity and respect. 

No one should have to make this kind of calculation, but the reality is that millions have and millions more will, said Elizabeth Kristen, an employment attorney at Legal Aid at Work. Here’s what you should know to make the most informed decision possible:

## Document Everything

Two types of sexual harassment are illegal under federal law, though some behavior may still violate your company’s sexual harassment policy, if it has one, even if it doesn’t meet the legal definition. 

These two types of harassment are quid pro quo harassment, when some aspect of your employment is contingent upon fulfilling a sexual request (“If you go on a date with me, I’ll give you more hours”), and hostile work environment harassment, unwanted behavior that is severe or pervasive and disrupts or interferes with your work (unwanted touching, suggestive texts or emails, or sharing sexually explicit images or videos).

Regardless of the type of harassment you are experiencing, it is important to document everything. Write down details such as:

* The date, time and location of the harassment, what happened, what was said and who witnessed the behavior. 
* Keep copies or take screenshots of any relevant emails, texts, photos or social posts. 
* Tell a trusted friend, family member or co-worker what happened and write down the details of those conversations. Not only can they provide support, but they may also be able to provide corroborating statements should you need them. 
* Keep records related to your productivity and job performance and, if possible, review your performance report or personnel file. This is so you have evidence should your performance ever be disputed.
* Store all documentation outside your office or your work computer and make sure it’s backed up in a safe place.   
* Keep in mind: Secretly recording harassment can provide valuable evidence, but check your state’s laws before you do so. In some states it is illegal to record a conversation without both parties’ consent. Some company policies also prohibit recording.
